A *Workday Inspire* reader shared this process time-study that served as a major morale boost at his/her workplace:

Hi All,

I have just completed a careful time-study of the Dirty Dish Process, and I have some findings that I would like to share. Please see below summary:

## Process Definitions

- `Device` – Dirty dish, spoon, fork, knife, coffee mug, bowl, plate, etc
- `Device Processing Area` – One of the two kitchens in the building
- `Device Staging Zone` – Sink in the Device Processing Area
- `Device Cleansing Equipment` – Dishwasher in the Device Processing Area
- `Pre-Cycle Setup` – Starting the Device Cleansing Equipment
- `Post-Cycle Maintenance` – Unloading the Device Cleansing Equipment

## Desired Process Results

Devices dispositioned in the Device Cleansing Equipment
 
## Process Assumptions

- You have a Device which needs to be dispositioned
- You walk into one of the Device Processing Areas to disposition the Device
- The Device Cleansing Equipment is not running, full, or just completed

    1. If the Device Cleansing Equipment is running, you disposition the Device in the Device Staging Zone
    2. If the Device Cleansing Equipment is full, you perform the Pre-Cycle Setup (*see Note 1*)
    3. If the Device Cleansing Equipment has just completed its cycle, you perform the Post-Cycle Maintenance (*see Note 1*) and then disposition your Device

- Your decision is limited to:

    1. Placing the Device in the Device Staging Zone
    2. Placing the Device in the Device Cleansing Equipment

NOTE: If your decision process involves options outside of the above two, please come talk to me.

## Time Study Results

After careful analysis I calculated the time difference between the two assumed decisions (Device Staging Zone vs. Device Cleansing Equipment). It takes an additional 0.5 seconds (on average) to place the Device in the Device Cleansing Equipment as opposed to the Device Staging Zone.

## Recommendations

I have come up with some options to help recover this 0.5 sec per Device disposition which will be required of some of you to achieve the Desired Process Results:

1. Blink 3.27 fewer times
2. Extend your normal stride by 0.35 mm on your way to the Device Processing Area
3. Type 1.3 fewer letters in any correspondence
4. Speak 1.04 fewer words in any conversation
5. Stop reading this email (this will recover time required to properly disposition 7.39 Devices)

For additional insights, please refer to *Notes 2 and 3* below.

## Notes

1. If you need help with Pre-Cycle Setup or Post-Cycle Maintenance, I offer a free 3-Day course covering the requirements and proper steps. At the end of the course you will be fully trained and certified to perform these steps.
2. You can scale these recommendations based on the number of devices you need to disposition per day.
3. These are not the only options to recover this time, feel free to perform your own testing

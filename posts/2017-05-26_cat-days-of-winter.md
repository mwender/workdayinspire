Growing up our neighbors had a cat named Fat cat. He was a good cat and to my recollection never acted persnickety like most cats do. One cold day in my early childhood he died. We found him in a state of rigor mortis, and being unwilling to let go, we played with our stiff feline friend for a few hours. Posed and propped up he was a fierce lion in the captive of the real 12" tall GI Joe. In another scenario he cooperatively played the role of cat horse. 

*Dang that cat was cool!*

But, as life dictated and the day warmed it was time to bury our stiff friend. A small ceremony was held that included placing a hand carved stone bearing the name “Fat Cat” over the mound of dirt where he lay. And, as quickly as the day had begun it was now over.

Sometimes gifts come in odd forms. But, those are often the best. Don’t let the dead cats in your life go by. Pick them up and play with them.

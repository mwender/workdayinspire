A couple of weeks ago I was on my deck grilling burgers for our family. The hamburger meat was a perfect blend of beef and fat to allow for optimum flavor and great texture. The meat was prepped with the appropriate amount of spices and shaped into perfectly round balls before flattening into nicely shaped patties. The meat was then brought to room temperature over a 30 minute period while the grill was heated to about 450°F.

As the patties were laid onto the grill, sizzling commenced, and the grill cover was closed to allow for the burgers to properly cook. The aroma that wafted about the deck signaled to my mind via my olfactory nerve that my taste buds would soon satisfy their need for stimulation.

After probing the burgers to ensure they had attained the proper temperature, I removed them from the grill, covered them, and allowed them to rest for approximately 5 minutes while I prepped my bun with a brush of mustard and ketchup.

“Let’s eat” rang out through the house. With smiles, we all gathered around the table and gave thanks for our meal. Each person grabbed the burger they had eyed during the prayer and placed it on their bun.

I applied 1 piece of pre-trimmed lettuce sized perfectly and picked the tomato slice that appeared the correct diameter to fit within the confines of my burger. Two bread and butter pickles and the lid to my creation were all that remained. I laid the 2 pickles strips in parallel, centered by eye on the tomato and placed the bun perfectly, taking care to not leave finger indentions.

I paused for dramatic effect before picking up my treasure. Parched from my time on the deck cooking, I determined my palate needed cleansing. Without moving my head, I eyed my room temperature water and slowly reached for my glass. In slow motion high definition mental video, my eyes saw my hands nudge my glass tipping it towards my plate. Water leaped from the glass and landed perfectly on my bun. I heard the water remaining in the glass sing out with a loud resounding “10!”

The burger appeared intact, but finger examination proved differently. How could this be? All the work. All the anticipation. My hunger had been replaced by *hanger*. I hated the very burger I was so wanting just a few moments prior.

Often in life we invest our hearts and efforts into our days only to have them dashed in a moment by some self-caused tragedy. *Don’t waste all that effort and passion!* Settle for a Krystal. They may not require you to do much more than ask for a 5 sack. They may not even taste all that good. But, I can guarantee one thing...You will end up with a soggy bun. Why not just settle in and realize it doesn't get any better than this.

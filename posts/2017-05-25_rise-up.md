When life gives you a wheat plant, don’t think “What the frick is this?”
Take hold of the stalk and thrash it on the floor. *But, don't stop there!*

- Pick up the grain, and grind out a fine powder.
- Mix with baking soda, baking powder, and add a little water.
- Bake at 350&deg; for 8 – 10 minutes.

And, by golly you have a biscuit.
 
Guys, don't think you have been simply given a plant. You have been given an opportunity.
 
*Now, go make a biscuit with your day!*
